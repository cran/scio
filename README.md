# scio #

This is an R package for **Sparse Column-wise Inverse Operator**. 

The easiest way to install this package from GitHub is by the following R code:

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("rluo/scio")

You can use `R CMD build scio` to build the source package.  This should yield the same as the CRAN package [scio](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=scio), because I will try to update the CRAN source as soon as I can.
